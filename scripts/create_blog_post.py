# {blog_title}

ROCm Blogs follow a consistent magazine article approach where there is no explicit introduction per se,
but rather each blog starts with a brief, wide-scoped introductory text, without a section title,
before moving into the blog’s first section.
The introductory text should include a concise description of your blog: briefly describe for the
reader how they will benefit from the blog, detailing its main deliverables. Please use an active-voice,
call-to-action approach.

## Body

This is where you unleash your creativity. Please follow these general guidelines:

• use actionable, hands-on, conversational approach, guiding your reader through the blog and its content, maintaining engagement. Use active voice, call-to-action (CTA) text (e.g. “Interested in learning more?”, “Run this function by using”, “Try implementing this yourself”)

• keep your writing structured, engaging, and actionable. Divide the blog’s content into logical sections. 

• Make sure you provide the required background and prerequisites for your blog. Outline any foundational knowledge and tools the reader will likely require.

• When describing a process use step-by-step guide, employ numbered steps or subheadings to guide the reader through the process.

• Integrate examples and use cases: provide real-world applications and scenarios. Reflect on common pitfalls and possible troubleshooting approaches, addressing potential mistakes and solutions.

Leeway into figures, equations, etc.

## Sample markdown

This section covers some markdown techniques commonly used in a blogs.

This is a table.

|      | SPX (MI300X) | CPX (MI300X) |
| ---- | :----------: | :----------: |
| NPS1 |      ✔       |      ✔       |
| NPS4 |              |      ✔       |

Below is a code snippet from the console. You can also use bash, C++, python and other languages.

```console
echo "c 226:128 rwm" > /sys/fs/cgroup/devices/devices.deny #Deny access to device 226:128 in docker (renderD128)

echo "c 226:128 rwm" > /sys/fs/cgroup/devices/devices.allow #Allow access to device 226:128 in docker (renderD128)
```

```{note}
This is how to add a note. See the [myst markdown admomition guide](https://mystmd.org/guide/admonitions) for more details.
```

## Summary

ROCm Blogs follow a consistent magazine-article approach where each blog ends with a “Summary” section.
Please provide a brief summary of your blog, reiterating the main takeaways and deliverables, as well
as what the reader learned from it.
