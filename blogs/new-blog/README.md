# New Blog
ROCm Blogs follow a consistent magazine article approach where there is no explicit introduction per se,
but rather each blog starts with a brief, wide-scoped introductory text, without a section title,
before moving into the blog’s first section.
The introductory text should include a concise description of your blog: briefly describe for the 
reader how they will benefit from the blog, detailing its main deliverables. Please use an active-voice,
call-to-action approach.

## Summary
ROCm Blogs follow a consistent magazine-article approach where each blog ends with a “Summary” section.
Please provide a brief summary of your blog, reiterating the main takeaways and deliverables, as well
as what the reader learned from it.
